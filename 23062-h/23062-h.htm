      <b>Author&rsquo;s Note</b>.&mdash;There is extant under this name a short piece
      by the author of &ldquo;Little Kate of Heilbronn.&rdquo; That and the tale which here
      follows originated in an incident which took place at Bern in the year
      1802. Henry von Kleist and Ludwig Wieland, the son of the poet, were both
      friends of the writer, in whose chamber hung an engraving called <i>La
      Cruche Cass√©e</i>, the persons and contents of which resembled the scene
      set forth below, under the head of The Tribunal. The drawing, which was
      full of expression, gave great delight to those who saw it, and led to
      many conjectures as to its meaning. The three friends agreed, in sport,
      that they would each one day commit to writing his peculiar interpretation
      of its design. Wieland promised a satire; Von Kleist threw off a comedy;
      and the author of the following tale what is here given.

    <h1>
      MARIETTA.
    </h1>
    <p>
      NAPOULE, it is true, is only a very little place on the bay of Cannes; yet
      it is pretty well known through all Provence. It lies in the shade of
      lofty evergreen palms, and darker orange trees; but that alone would not
      make it renowned. Still they say that there are grown the most luscious
      grapes, the sweetest roses, and the handsomest girls. I don&rsquo;t know but it
      is so; in the mean time I believe it most readily. Pity that Napoule is so
      small, and can not produce more luscious grapes, fragrant roses, and
      handsome maidens; especially, as we might then have some of them
      transplanted to our own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, ever since the foundation of Napoule, all the Napoulese women have
      been beauties, so the little Marietta was a wonder of wonders, as the
      chronicles of the place declare. She was called the <i>little</i>
      Marietta; yet she was not smaller than a girl of seventeen or thereabout
      ought to be, seeing that her forehead just reached up to the lips of a
      grown man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chronicles aforesaid had very good ground for speaking of Marietta. I,
      had I stood in the shoes of the chronicler, would have done the same. For
      Marietta, who until lately had lived with her mother Manon at Avignon,
      when she came back to her birthplace, quite upset the whole village.
      Verily, not the houses, but the people and their heads; and not the heads
      of all the people, but of those particularly whose heads and hearts are
      always in danger when in the neighborhood of two bright eyes. I know very
      well that such a position is no joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Manon would have done much better if she had remained at Avignon.
      But she had been left a small inheritance, by which she received at
      Napoule an estate consisting of some vine-hills, and a house that lay in
      the shadow of a rock, between certain olive trees and African acacias.
      This is a kind of thing which no unprovided widow ever rejects; and,
      accordingly, in her own estimation, she was as rich and happy as though
      she were the Countess of Provence or something like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much the worse was it for the good people of Napoule. They never
      suspected their misfortune, not having read in Homer how a single pretty
      woman had filled all Greece and Lesser Asia with discord and war.

    <h2>
      HOW THE MISFORTUNE CAME ABOUT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Marietta had scarcely been fourteen days in the house, between the olive
      trees and the African acacias, before every young man of Napoule knew that
      she lived there, and that there lived not, in all Provence, a more
      charming girl than the one in that house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Went she through the village, sweeping lightly along like a dressed-up
      angel, her frock, with its pale-green bodice, and orange leaves and
      rosebuds upon the bosom of it, fluttering in the breeze, and flowers and
      ribbons waving about the straw bonnet, which shaded her beautiful features&mdash;yes,
      then the grave old men spake out, and the young ones were struck dumb. And
      everywhere, to the right and left, little windows and doors were opened
      with a &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Good evening, Marietta,&rdquo; as it might be,
      while she nodded to the right and left with a pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Marietta walked into church, all hearts (that is, of the young people)
      forgot Heaven; all eyes turned from the saints, and the worshiping finger
      wandered idly among the pearls of the rosary. This must certainly have
      provoked much sorrow, at least, among the more devout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maidens of Napoule particularly became very pious about this time, for
      they, most of all, took the matter to heart. And they were not to be
      blamed for it; for since the advent of Marietta more than one prospective
      groom had become cold, and more than one worshipper of some beloved one
      quite inconstant. There were bickerings and reproaches on all sides, many
      tears, pertinent lectures, and even rejections. The talk was no longer of
      marriages, but of separations. They began to return their pledges of
      troth, rings, ribbons, etc. The old persons took part with their children;
      criminations and strife spread from house to house; it was most
      deplorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marietta is the cause of all, said the pious maidens first; then the
      mothers said it; next the fathers took it up; and finally all&mdash;even
      the young men. But Marietta, shielded by her modesty and innocence, like
      the petals of the rosebud in its dark-green calix, did not suspect the
      mischief of which she was the occasion, and continued courteous to
      everybody. This touched the young men, who said, &ldquo;Why condemn the pure and
      harmless child&mdash;she is not guilty!&rdquo; Then the fathers said the same
      thing; then the mothers took it up, and finally all&mdash;even the pious
      maidens. For, let who would talk with Marietta, she was sure to gain their
      esteem. So before half a year had passed, everybody had spoken to her, and
      everybody loved her. But she did not suspect that she was the object of
      such general regard, as she had not before suspected that she was the
      object of dislike. Does the violet, hidden in the downtrodden grass, think
      how sweet it is?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now every one wished to make amends for the injustice they had done
      Marietta. Sympathy deepened the tenderness of their attachment. Marietta
      found herself greeted everywhere in a more friendly way than ever; she was
      more cordially welcomed; more heartily invited to the rural sports and
      dances.

    <h2>
      ABOUT THE WICKED COLIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      All men, however, are not endowed with tender sympathy; some have hearts
      hardened like Pharaoh&rsquo;s. This arises, no doubt, from that natural
      depravity which has come upon men in consequence of the fall of Adam, or
      because, at their baptism, the devil is not brought sufficiently under
      subjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      A remarkable example of this hardness of heart was given by one Colin, the
      richest farmer and proprietor in Napoule, whose vineyards and olive
      gardens, whose lemon and orange trees could hardly be counted in a day.
      One thing particularly demonstrates the perverseness of his disposition;
      he was twenty-seven years old, and had never yet asked for what purpose
      girls had been created!
    </p>
    <p>
      True, all the people, especially damsels of a certain age, willingly
      forgave him this sin, and looked upon him as one of the best young men
      under the sun. His fine figure, his fresh, unembarrassed manner, his look,
      his laugh, enabled him to gain the favorable opinion of the aforesaid
      people, who would have forgiven him, had there been occasion, any one of
      the deadly sins. But the decision of such judges is not always to be
      trusted. While both old and young at Napoule had become reconciled to the
      innocent Marietta, and proffered their sympathies to her, Colin was the
      only one who had no pity upon the poor child. If Marietta was talked of he
      became as dumb as a fish. If he met her in the street he would turn red
      and white with anger, and cast sidelong glances at her of the most
      malicious kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If at evening the young people met upon the seashore near the old castle
      ruins for sprightly pastimes, or rural dances, or to sing catches, Colin
      was the merriest among them. But as soon as Marietta arrived the rascally
      fellow was silent, and all the gold in the world couldn&rsquo;t make him sing.&mdash;What
      a pity, when he had such a fine voice! Everybody listened to it so
      willingly, and its store of songs was endless.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the maidens looked kindly upon Colin, and he was friendly with all of
      them. He had, as we have said, a roguish glance, which the lasses feared
      and loved; and it was so sweet they would like to have had it painted.
      But, as might naturally be expected, the offended Marietta did not look
      graciously upon him. And in that he was perfectly right. Whether he smiled
      or not, it was all the same to her. As to his roguish glance, why she
      would never hear it mentioned; and therein too she was perfectly right.
      When he told a tale (and he knew thousands) and everybody listened, she
      nudged her neighbor, or perhaps threw tufts of grass at Peter or Paul, and
      laughed and chattered, and did not listen to Colin at all. This behavior
      quite provoked the proud fellow, so that he would break off in the middle
      of his story and stalk sullenly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revenge is sweet. The daughter of Mother Manon well knew how to triumph.
      Yet Marietta was a right good child and quite too tenderhearted. If Colin
      was silent, it gave her pain. If he was downcast, she laughed no more. If
      he went away, she did not stay long behind: but hurried to her home, and
      wept tears of repentance, more beautiful than those of the Magdalen,
      although she had not sinned like the Magdalen.

    <h2>
      THE CUP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Father Jerome, the pastor of Napoule, was an old man of seventy, who
      possessed all the virtues of a saint, and only one failing; which was,
      that by reason of his advanced years, he was hard of hearing. But, on that
      very account, his homilies were more acceptable to the children of his
      baptism and blessing. True, he preached only of two subjects, as if they
      comprehended the whole of religion. It was either &ldquo;Little children, love
      one another,&rdquo; or it was &ldquo;Mysterious are the ways of Providence.&rdquo; And truly
      there is so much Faith, Love, and Hope in these that one might at a pinch
      be saved by them. The little children loved one another most obediently,
      and trusted in the ways of Providence. Only Colin, with his flinty heart,
      would know nothing of either: for even when he professed to be friendly,
      he entertained the deepest malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Napoulese went to the annual market or fair of the city of Vence. It
      was truly a joyful time, and though they had but little gold to buy with,
      there were many goods to look at. Now Marietta and Mother Manon went to
      the fair with the rest, and Colin was also there. He bought a great many
      curiosities and trifles for his friends&mdash;but he would not spend a
      farthing for Marietta. And yet he was always at her elbow, though he did
      not speak to her, nor she to him. It was easy to see that he was brooding
      over some scheme of wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Manon stood gazing before a shop, when she suddenly exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Marietta, see that beautiful cup! A queen would not be ashamed to
      raise it to her lips. Only see: the edge is of dazzling gold, and the
      flowers upon it could not bloom more beautifully in the garden, although
      they are only painted. And in the midst of this Paradise! pray see,
      Marietta, how the apples are smiling on the trees. They are verily
      tempting. And Adam cannot withstand it, as the enchanting Eve offers him
      one for food! And do see how prettily the little frisking lamb skips
      around the old tiger, and the snow-white dove with her golden throat
      stands there before the vulture, as if she would caress him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marietta could not satisfy herself with looking. &ldquo;Had I such a cup,
      mother!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is far too beautiful to drink out of: I would place
      my flowers in it and constantly peep into Paradise. We are at the fair in
      Vence, but when I look on the picture I feel as if I were in Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So spoke Marietta, and called her companions to the spot, to share her
      admiration of the cup: but the young men soon joined the maidens, until at
      length almost half the inhabitants of Napoule were assembled before the
      wonderfully beautiful cup. But miraculously beautiful was it mainly from
      its inestimable, translucent porcelain, with gilded handles and glowing
      colors. They asked the merchant timidly: &ldquo;Sir, what is the price of it?&rdquo;
       And he answered: &ldquo;Among friends, it is worth a hundred livres.&rdquo; Then they
      all became silent, and went away in despair. When the Napoulese were all
      gone from the front of the shop, Colin came there by stealth, threw the
      merchant a hundred livres upon the counter, had the cup put in a box well
      packed with cotton, and then carried it off. What evil plans he had in
      view no one would have surmised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near Napoule, on his way home, it being already dusk, he met old Jacques,
      the Justice&rsquo;s servant, returning from the fields. Jacques was a very good
      man, but excessively stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give thee money enough to get something to drink, Jacques,&rdquo; said
      Colin, &ldquo;if thou wilt bear this box to Manon&rsquo;s house, and leave it there;
      and if any one should see thee, and inquire from whom the box came, say &lsquo;A
      stranger gave it to me.&rsquo; But never disclose my name, or I will always
      detest thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacques promised this, took the drink-money and the box, and went with it
      toward the little dwelling between the olive trees and the African
      acacias.

    <h2>
      THE CARRIER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before he arrived there he encountered his master, Justice Hautmartin, who
      asked; &ldquo;Jacques, what art thou carrying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A box for Mother Manon. But, sir, I cannot say from whom it comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Colin would always detest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well that thou canst keep a secret. But it is already late; give me
      the box, for I am going to-morrow to see Mother Manon; I will deliver it
      to her and not betray that it came from Colin. It will save thee a walk,
      and furnish me a good excuse for calling on the old lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacques gave the box to his master, whom he was accustomed to obey
      implicitly in all things. The justice bore it into his chamber, and
      examined it by the light with some curiosity. On the lid was neatly
      written with red chalk: &ldquo;For the lovely and dear Marietta.&rdquo; But Monsieur
      Hautmartin well knew that this was some of Colin&rsquo;s mischief, and that some
      knavish trick lurked under the whole. He therefore opened the box
      carefully for fear that a mouse or rat should be concealed within. When he
      beheld the wondrous cup, which he had seen at Vence, he was dreadfully
      shocked, for Monsieur Hautmartin was a skilful casuist, and knew that the
      inventions and devices of the human heart are evil from our youth upward.
      He saw at once that Colin designed this cup as a means of bringing
      misfortune upon Marietta: perhaps to give out, when it should be in her
      possession, that it was the present of some successful lover in the town,
      or the like, so that all decent people would thereafter keep aloof from
      Marietta. Therefore Monsieur Hautmartin resolved, in order to prevent any
      evil reports, to profess himself the giver. Moreover, he loved Marietta,
      and would gladly have seen her observe more strictly toward himself the
      sayings of the gray-headed priest Jerome, &ldquo;Little children, love one
      another.&rdquo; In truth, Monsieur Hautmartin was a little child of fifty years
      old, and Marietta did not think the saying applied particularly to him.
      Mother Manon, on the contrary, thought that the justice was a clever
      little child, he had gold and a high reputation from one end of Napoule to
      the other. And when the justice spoke of marriage, and Marietta ran away
      in affright, Mother Manon remained sitting, and had no fear for the tall,
      staid gentleman. It must also be confessed there were no faults in his
      person. And although Colin might be the handsomest man in the village, yet
      the justice far surpassed him in two things, namely, in the number of
      years, and in a very, very big nose. Yes, this nose, which always went
      before the justice like a herald to proclaim his approach, was a real
      elephant among human noses.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this proboscis, his good purpose, and the cup, the justice went the
      following morning to the house between the olive trees and the African
      acacias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the beautiful Marietta,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I hold nothing too costly.
      Yesterday you admired the cup at Vence; to-day allow me, lovely Marietta,
      to lay it and my devoted heart at your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manon and Marietta were transported beyond measure when they beheld the
      cup. Manon&rsquo;s eyes glistened with delight, but Marietta turned and said: &ldquo;I
      can neither take your heart nor your cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mother Marion was angry, and cried out: &ldquo;But I accept both heart and
      cup. Oh, thou little fool, how long wilt thou despise thy good fortune!
      For whom dost thou tarry? Will a count of Provence make thee his bride,
      that thou scornest the Justice of Napoule? I know better how to look after
      my interests. Monsieur Hautmartin, I deem it an honor to call thee my
      son-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Marietta went out and wept bitterly, and hated the beautiful cup with
      all her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the justice, drawing the palm of his flabby hand over his nose, spoke
      thus judiciously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Manon, hurry nothing. The dove will at length, when it learns to
      know me better, give way. I am not impetuous. I have some skill among
      women, and before a quarter of a year passes by I will insinuate myself
      into Marietta&rsquo;s good graces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy nose is too large for that,&rdquo; whispered Marietta, who listened outside
      the door and laughed to herself. In fact, the quarter of a year passed by
      and Monsieur Hautmartin had not yet pierced the heart even with the tip of
      his nose.

    <h2>
      THE FLOWERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During this quarter of a year Marietta had other affairs to attend to. The
      cup gave her much vexation and trouble, and something else besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a fortnight nothing else was talked of in Napoule, and every one said
      it is a present from the justice, and the marriage is already agreed upon.
      Marietta solemnly declared to all her companions that she would rather
      plunge to the bottom of the sea than marry the justice, but the maidens
      continued to banter her all the more, saying: &ldquo;Oh, how blissful it must be
      to repose in the shadow of his nose!&rdquo; This was her first vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mother Manon had the cruelty to force Marietta to rinse out the cup
      every morning at the spring under the rock and to fill it with fresh
      flowers. She hoped by this to accustom Marietta to the cup and heart of
      the giver. But Marietta continued to hate both the gift and giver, and her
      work at the spring became an actual punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when in the morning, she came to the spring, twice every week she
      found on the rock, immediately over it, some most beautiful flowers,
      handsomely arranged, all ready for the decoration of the cup. And on the
      flower-stalks a strip of paper was always tied, on which was written,
      &ldquo;Dear Marietta.&rdquo; Now no one need expect to impose upon little Marietta as
      if magicians and fairies were still in the world. Consequently she knew
      that both the flowers and papers must have come from Monsieur Hautmartin.
      Marietta, indeed, would not smell them because the living breath from out
      of the justice&rsquo;s nose had perfumed them. Nevertheless she took the
      flowers, because they were finer than wild flowers, and tore the slip of
      paper into a thousand pieces, which she strewed upon the spot where the
      flowers usually lay. But this did not vex Justice Hautmartin, whose love
      was unparalleled in its kind as his nose was in its kind. Third vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length it came out in conversation with Monsieur Hautmartin that he was
      not the giver of the beautiful flowers. Then who could it be? Marietta was
      utterly astounded at the unexpected discovery. Thenceforth she took the
      flowers from the rock more kindly; but, further, Marietta was&mdash;what
      maidens are not wont to be&mdash;very inquisitive. She conjectured first
      this and then that young man in Napoule. Yet her conjectures were in vain.
      She looked and listened far into the night; she rose earlier than usual
      But she looked and listened in vain. And still twice a week in the morning
      the miraculous flowers lay upon the rock, and upon the strip of paper
      wound round them she always read the silent sigh, &ldquo;Dear Marietta!&rdquo; Such an
      incident would have made even the most indifferent inquisitive. But
      curiosity at length became a burning pain. Fourth vexation.

    <h2>
      WICKEDNESS UPON WICKEDNESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now Father Jerome, on Sunday, had again preached from the text:
      &ldquo;Mysterious are the dispensations of Providence.&rdquo; And little Marietta
      thought, if Providence would only dispense that I might at length find out
      who is the flower dispenser. Father Jerome was never wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a summer night, when it was far too warm to rest, Marietta awoke very
      early, and could not resume her sleep. Therefore she sprang joyously from
      her couch as the first streaks of dawn flashed against the window of her
      little chamber, over the waves of the sea and the Lerinian Isles, dressed
      herself, and went out to wash her forehead, breast, and arms in the cool
      spring. She took her hat with her, intending to take a walk by the
      sea-shore, as she knew of a retired place for bathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to reach this retired spot, it was necessary to pass over the
      rocks behind the house, and thence down through the orange and palm trees.
      On this occasion Marietta could not pass through them; for, under the
      youngest and most slender of the palms lay a tall young man in profound
      sleep&mdash;near him a nosegay of most splendid flowers. A white paper lay
      thereon, from which probably a sigh was again breathing. How could
      Marietta get by there?
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood still, trembling with fright. She would go home again. Hardly
      had she retreated a couple of steps, ere she looked again at the sleeper
      and remained motionless. Yet the distance prevented her from recognizing
      his face. Now the mystery was to be solved, or never. She tripped lightly
      nearer to the palms; but he seemed to stir&mdash;then she ran again toward
      the cottage. His movements were but the fearful imaginings of Marietta.
      Now she returned again on her way toward the palms; but his sleep might
      perhaps be only dissembled&mdash;swiftly she ran toward the cottage&mdash;but
      who would flee for a mere probability? She trod more boldly the path
      toward the palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these fluctuations of her timid and joyous spirit, between fright and
      curiosity, with these to-and-fro trippings between the house and the
      palm-trees, she at length nearly approached the sleeper; at the same time
      curiosity became more powerful than fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he to me? My way leads me directly past him. Whether he sleeps or
      wakes, I will go straight on.&rdquo; So thought Manon&rsquo;s daughter. But she passed
      not by, but stood looking directly in the face of the flower-giver, in
      order to be certain who it was. Besides, he slept as if it were the first
      time in a month. And who was it? Now, who else should it be but the
      archwicked Colin.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was <i>he</i> who had annoyed the gentle maiden, and given her so
      much trouble with Monsieur Hautmartin, because he bore a grudge against
      her; he had been the one who had teased her with flowers, in order to
      torture her curiosity. Wherefore? He hated Marietta. He behaved himself
      always most shamefully toward the poor child. He avoided her when he
      could; and when he could not, he grieved the good-natured little one. With
      all the other maidens of Napoule he was more chatty, friendly, courteous,
      than toward Marietta. Consider&mdash;he had never once asked her to dance,
      and yet she danced bewitchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there he lay, surprised, taken in the act. Revenge swelled in
      Marietta&rsquo;s bosom. What disgrace could she subject him to? She took the
      nosegay, unloosened it, strewed his present over the sleeper in scorn. But
      the paper, on which appeared again the sigh, &ldquo;Dear Marietta!&rdquo; she
      retained, and thrust quickly into her bosom. She wished to preserve this
      proof of his handwriting. Marietta was sly. Now she would go away. But her
      revenge was not yet satisfied. She could not leave the place without
      returning Colin&rsquo;s ill-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the violet-colored silken ribbon from her hat, and threw it
      lightly around the sleeper&rsquo;s arm and around the tree, and with three knots
      tied Colin fast. Now when he awoke, how astonished he would be! How his
      curiosity would torment him to ascertain who had played him this trick! He
      could not possibly know. So much the better; it served him right. She
      seemed to regret her work when she had finished it. Her bosom throbbed
      impetuously. Indeed, I believe that a little tear filled her eye, as she
      compassionately gazed upon the guilty one. Slowly she retreated to the
      orange grove by the rocks&mdash;she looked around often&mdash;slowly
      ascended the rocks, looking down among the palm trees as she ascended.
      Then she hastened to Mother Manon, who was calling her.

    <h2>
      THE HAT BAND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That very day Colin practised new mischief. What did he? He wished to
      shame the poor Marietta publicly. Ah! she never thought that every one in
      Napoule knew her violet-colored ribbon! Colin remembered it but too well.
      Proudly he bound it around his hat, and exhibited it to the gaze of all
      the world as a conquest. And male and female cried out: &ldquo;He has received
      it from Marietta.&rdquo;&mdash;And all the maidens said angrily: &ldquo;The
      reprobate!&rdquo; And all the young men who liked to see Marietta cried out:
      &ldquo;The reprobate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! Mother Manon?&rdquo; shrieked the Justice Hautmartin when he came to her
      house, and he shrieked so loudly that it re-echoed wonderfully through his
      nose. &ldquo;How! do you suffer this? my betrothed presents the young proprietor
      Colin with her hat-band! It is high time that we celebrate our nuptials.
      When that is over, then I shall have a right to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a right!&rdquo; answered Mother Manon, &ldquo;if things are so, the marriage
      must take place forthwith. When that is done, all will go right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mother Manon, Marietta always refuses to give me her consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prepare the marriage feast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she will not even look kindly at me; and when I seat myself at her
      side, the little savage jumps up and runs away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Justice, only prepare the marriage feast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if Marietta resists&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will take her by surprise. We will go to Father Jerome on Monday
      morning early, and he shall quietly celebrate the marriage. This we can
      easily accomplish with him. I am her mother, you the first judicial person
      in Napoule. He must obey. Marietta need know nothing about it. Early on
      Monday morning I will send her to Father Jerome all alone, with a message
      so that she will suspect nothing. Then the priest shall speak earnestly to
      her. Half an hour afterward we two will come. Then swiftly to the altar.
      And even if Marietta should then say No, what does it matter? The old
      Priest can hear nothing. But till then, mum to Marietta and all Napoule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the secret remained with the two. Marietta dreamed not of the good luck
      which was in store for her. She thought only of Colin&rsquo;s wickedness, which
      had made her the common talk of the whole place. Oh! how she repented her
      heedlessness about the ribbon; and yet in her heart she forgave the
      reprobate his crime. Marietta was far too good. She told her mother, she
      told all her playmates, &ldquo;Colin has found my lost hat band. I never gave it
      to him. He only wishes to vex me with it. You all know that Colin was
      always ill-disposed towards me, and always sought to mortify me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! the poor child! she knew not what new abomination the malicious fellow
      was again contriving.

    <h2>
      THE BROKEN CUP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early in the morning Marietta went to the spring with the cup. There were
      no flowers yet on the rock. It was still quite too early; for the sun had
      scarcely risen from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Footsteps were heard. Colin came in sight, the flowers in his hand.
      Marietta became very red. Colin stammered out &ldquo;good morning, Marietta,&rdquo;
       but the greeting came not from his heart, he could hardly bring it over
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why dost thou wear my ribbon so publicly, Colin?&rdquo; said Marietta, and
      placed the cup upon the rock. &ldquo;I did not give it thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou didst not give it to me, dear Marietta?&rdquo; asked he, and inward rage
      made him deadly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marietta was ashamed of the falsehood, drooped her eyelids, and said after
      a while, &ldquo;Well, I did give it to thee, yet thou shouldst not have worn it
      so openly. Give it me back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he untied it; his anger was so great that he could not prevent the
      tears from filling his eyes, nor the sighs from escaping his breast.&mdash;&ldquo;Dear
      Marietta, leave thy ribbon with me,&rdquo; said he softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his suppressed passion changed into desperation. Sighing, he looked
      towards Heaven, then sadly on Marietta, who, silent and abashed, stood by
      the spring with downcast eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wound the violet coloured ribbon around the stalks of the flowers, said
      &ldquo;there, take them all,&rdquo; and threw the flowers so spitefully against the
      magnificent cup upon the rock, that it was thrown down and dashed to
      pieces. Maliciously he fled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Manon lurking behind the window, had seen and heard all. When the
      cup broke, hearing and sight left her. She was scarcely able to speak for
      very horror. And as she pushed with all her strength against the narrow
      window, to shout after the guilty one, it gave way, and with one crash
      fell to the earth and was shattered in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much ill luck would have discomposed any other woman. But Manon soon
      recovered herself. &ldquo;How lucky that I was a witness to this roguery!&rdquo;
       exclaimed she; &ldquo;he must to the Justice.&mdash;He shall replace both cup
      and window-sash with his gold. It will give a rich dowry to Marietta But
      when Marietta brought in the fragments of the shattered cup, when Manon
      saw the Paradise lost, the good man Adam without a head, and of Eve not a
      solitary limb remaining, the serpent unhurt, triumphing, the tiger safe,
      but the little lamb gone even to the very tail, as if the tiger had
      swallowed it, then Mother Manon screamed forth curses against Colin, and
      said: &lsquo;One can easily see that this <i>fall</i> came from the hand of the
      devil.&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE TRIBUNAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      She took the cup in one hand, Marietta in the other, and went, about nine
      o&rsquo;clock, to when Monsieur Hautmartin was wont to sit in judgment. She
      there made a great outcry, and showed the broken cup and the Paradise
      lost. Marietta wept bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The justice, when he saw the broken cup and his beautiful bride in tears,
      flew into so violent a rage toward Colin that his nose was as
      violet-colored as Marietta&rsquo;s well-known hat-band, He immediately
      despatched his bailiffs to bring the criminal before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colin came, overwhelmed with grief. Mother Manon now repeated her
      complaint with great eloquence before justice, bailiffs, and scribes.&mdash;But
      Colin listened not. He stepped to Marietta and whispered to hen &ldquo;Forgive
      me, dear Marietta, as I forgive thee. I broke thy cup unintentionally; but
      thou, thou hast broken my heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What whispering is that?&rdquo; cried Justice Hautmartin, with magisterial
      authority. &ldquo;Harken to this accusation, and defend yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have naught to defend. I broke the cup against my will,&rdquo; said Colin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I verily believe,&rdquo; said Marietta, sobbing. &ldquo;I am as guilty as he;
      for I offended him&mdash;then he threw the ribbon and flowers to me. He
      could not help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Mother Manon. &ldquo;Do you intend to defend him? Mr. Justice,
      pronounce his sentence. He has broken the cup, and he does not deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you cannot deny it, Mr. Colin,&rdquo; said the Justice, &ldquo;you must pay
      three hundred livres for the cup, for it is worth that; and then for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; interrupted Colin, &ldquo;it is not worth that. I bought it at Vence for
      Marietta for a hundred livres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bought it, sir brazen face?&rdquo; shrieked the Justice, and his whole face
      became like Marietta&rsquo;s hat-hand. He could not and would not say more, for
      he dreaded a disagreeable investigation of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Colin was vexed at the imputation, and said: &ldquo;I sent this cup on the
      evening of the fair, by your own servant, to Marietta. There stands
      Jacques in the door. Speak, Jacques, did I not give thee the box to carry
      to Mother Manon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Hautmartin wished to interrupt this conversation by speaking
      loudly. But the simple Jacques said: &ldquo;Only recollect, Justice, you took
      away Colin&rsquo;s box from me, and carried what was in it to Mother Manon. The
      box lies there under the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the bailiffs were ordered to remove the simpleton; and Colin was also
      directed to retire, until he should be sent for again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Justice,&rdquo; interposed Colin, &ldquo;but this business shall be
      your last in Napoule. I know this, that you would ingratiate yourself with
      Mother Manon and Marietta by means of my property. When you want me, you
      will have to ride to Grasse to the Governor&rsquo;s.&rdquo; With that, Colin departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Hautmartin was quite puzzled with this affair, and in his
      confusion knew not what he was about. Manon shook her head. The affair was
      dark and mysterious to her. &ldquo;Who will now pay me for the broken cup?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; said Marietta, with glowing, brightened countenance, &ldquo;<i>to me</i>
      it is already paid for.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MYSTERIOUS DISPENSATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Colin rode that same day to the Governor at Grasse, and came back early
      the next morning. But Justice Hautmartin only laughed at him, and removed
      all of Mother Manon&rsquo;s suspicions by swearing he would let his nose be cut
      off if Colin did not pay three hundred livres for the broken cup. He also
      went with Mother Manon to talk with Father Jerome about the marriage, and
      impressed upon him the necessity of earnestly setting before Marietta her
      duty <i>as</i> an obedient daughter in not opposing the will of her
      mother. This the pious old man promised, although he understood not the
      half of what they shouted in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Monday morning came Mother Manon said to her daughter: &ldquo;Dress
      yourself handsomely, and carry this myrtle wreath to Father Jerome; he
      wants it for a bride.&rdquo; Marietta dressed herself in her Sunday clothes,
      took the myrtle wreath unsuspiciously, and carried it to Father Jerome.

    <p>
      On the way Colin met her, and greeted her joyfully, though timidly; and
      when she told him where she was taking the wreath, Colin said: &ldquo;I am going
      the same way, for I am carrying the money for the church&rsquo;s tenths to the
      priest.&rdquo; And as they went on he took her hand silently, and both trembled
      as if they designed some crime against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast thou forgiven me?&rdquo; whispered Colin, anxiously. &ldquo;Ah! Marietta, what
      have I done to thee, that thou art so cruel toward me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could only say: &ldquo;Be quiet, Colin, you shall have the ribbon again; and
      I will preserve the cup since it came from you! Did it really come from
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Marietta, canst thou doubt it? All I have I would gladly give thee.
      Wilt thou, hereafter, be as kind to me as thou art to others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replied not. But as she entered the parsonage she looked aside at him,
      and when she saw his fine eyes filled with tears, she whispered softly:
      &ldquo;Dear Colin!&rdquo; Then he bent down and kissed her hand. With this the door of
      a chamber opened and Father Jerome, with venerable aspect, stood before
      them. The young couple held fast to each other. I know not whether this
      was the effect of the hand-kissing, or the awe they felt for the sage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marietta handed him the myrtle wreath. He laid it upon her head and said:
      &ldquo;Little children, love one another;&rdquo; and then urged the good maiden, in
      the most touching and pathetic manner, to love Colin. For the old
      gentleman, from his hardness of hearing, had either mistaken the name of
      the bridegroom, or forgotten it, and thought Colin must be the bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Marietta&rsquo;s heart softened under the exhortation, and with tears and
      sobs she exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah! I have loved him for a long time, but he hates
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate thee, Marietta?&rdquo; cried Colin. &ldquo;My soul has lived only in thee
      since thou earnest to Napoule. Oh! Marietta, how could I hope and believe
      that thou didst love me? Does not all Napoule worship thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, dost thou avoid me, Colin, and prefer all my companions before
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Marietta, I feared and trembled with love and anxiety when I beheld
      thee; I had not the courage to approach thee; and when I was away from
      thee I was most miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they talked thus with each other the good father thought they were
      quarreling; and he threw his arms around them, brought them together, and
      said imploringly: &ldquo;Little children, love one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Marietta sank on Colin&rsquo;s breast, and Colin threw his arms around her,
      and both faces beamed with rapture. They forgot the priest, the whole
      world. Each was sunk into the other, Both had so completely lost their
      recollection that, unwittingly, they followed the delightful Father Jerome
      into the church and before the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marietta!&rdquo; sighed he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colin!&rdquo; sighed she.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the church there were many devout worshipers; but they witnessed
      Colin&rsquo;s and Marietta&rsquo;s marriage with amazement. Many ran out before the
      close of the ceremony, to spread the news throughout Napoule: &ldquo;Colin and
      Marietta are married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the solemnization was over, Father Jerome rejoiced that he had
      succeeded so well, and that such little opposition had been made by the
      parties. He led them into the parsonage.

    <h2>
      END OF THIS MEMORABLE HISTORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then Mother Manon arrived, breathless; she had waited at home a long time
      for the bride-groom. He had not arrived. At the last stroke of the clock
      she grew anxious and went to Monsieur Hautmartin&rsquo;s. There anew surprise
      awaited her. She learned that the Governor, together with the officers of
      the Viguerie, had appeared and taken possession of the accounts, chests,
      and papers of the justice and at the same time arrested Monsieur
      Hautmartin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, surely, is the work of that wicked Colin,&rdquo; thought she, and hurried
      to the parsonage in order to apologize to Father Jerome for delaying the
      marriage. The good gray-headed old man advanced toward her, proud of his
      work, and leading by the hand the newly married pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mother Manon lost her wits and her speech in good earnest when she
      learned what had happened. But Colin had more thoughts and power of speech
      than in his whole previous life. He told of his love and the broken cup,
      the falsehood of the justice, and how he had unmasked this unjust
      magistrate in the Viguerie at Grasse. Then he besought Mother Manon&rsquo;s
      blessing, since all this had happened without any fault on the part of
      Marietta or himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jerome, who for a long while could not make out what had happened,
      when he received a full explanation of the marriage through mistake,
      piously folded his hands and exclaimed, with uplifted eyes: &ldquo;Wonderful are
      the dispensations of Providence!&rdquo; Colin and Marietta kissed his hands;
      Mother Manon, through sheer veneration of heaven, gave the young couple
      her blessing, but remarked incidentally that her head seemed turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Manon herself was pleased with her son-in-law when she came to know
      the full extent of his property, and especially when she found that
      Monsieur Hautmartin and his nose had been arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But am I then really a wife?&rdquo; asked Marietta; &ldquo;and really Colin&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mother Manon nodded her head, and Marietta hung upon Colin&rsquo;s arm. Thus
      they went to Colin&rsquo;s farm, to his dwelling-house, through the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the flowers, Marietta,&rdquo; said Colin; &ldquo;how carefully I cultivated
      them for your cup!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colin, who had not expected so pleasant an event, now prepared a wedding
      feast on the spur of the occasion. Two days was it continued. All Napoule
      was feasted. Who shall describe Colin&rsquo;s extravagance?
    </p>
    <p>
      The broken cup is preserved in the family to the present day as a memorial
      and sacred relic.
